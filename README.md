If you have a camera connected, it will display the live camera feed.
Capture an image using your camera.
The captured image will also be converted to grayscale and shown on the webpage.
Notes
The grayscale conversion is done using the Python Imaging Library (PIL).
The resulting grayscale images are displayed using Streamlit.
